# Monetisation Project 
This project aims to showcase a method of monetising the winning party in a video game using an elo-token based system running on a model of a blockchain.

The project uses simple JavaScript, Request-Promise libraries, HTML, CSS and JSON to create a model of what a system using a real, secure Blockchain could look like for rewarding players of competitive games with a native chain token, similar to traditional elo rating systems.
